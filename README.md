## About

A task management web application built with Python and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework. It allows you to set tasks, assign performers and change their statuses. Registration and authentication are required to work with the system.

To provide users with a convenient, adaptive, modern interface, the project uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework.

The frontend is rendered on the backend. This means that the page is built by the DjangoTemplates backend, which returns prepared HTML. And this HTML is rendered by the server.

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is used as the object-relational database system.
